# Roadmap

Accepted work through **v12.8.1** is delivered in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## v13 (delivered through v13.5.0)

Goal: WRM explains a server instead of only connecting to it, and it can be extended from inside itself, in the spirit of Omarchy: an addon is a folder that is dropped in and discovered at runtime, not a plugin compiled into the core.

Delivered (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)):
- v13.0 log engine, service inventory, journal sources, AI log tools and the addon core (sandboxed panels, themes, WebAssembly server hooks);
- v13.1 service monitoring, wall-clock replay, recording levels and the community addon index with checksum-verified installs;
- v13.2 screen lock (#115);
- v13.3 the AI addon loop with drafts; v13.4 the OpenCode Go provider and fixes;
- v13.5.0 the log viewer, log search and log settings, the file editor with an AI assistant, log AI chats, and the Claude plugin, skills and MCP Registry entry.

Still open from v13:
- publish the community repository ("WRM Pro - community public addons", MIT, pull request plus CI validation and manual review);
- publish the Claude plugin to the MCP Registry (`server.json` is ready; publishing needs the owner's GitHub sign-in);
- addon CLI and administrator-driven hooks beyond a manual Run.

Addon decisions already taken: server code runs in a WASM sandbox (`wazero`, pure Go, no cgo) unless the operator opts into native code; UI addons register into defined slots and themes instead of touching core DOM; addons declare capabilities, which the installer shows before installing; the community index uses trust levels (`official`, `reviewed`, `community`, `unverified`) with checksums, plus a security and hobby-project liability notice.

## Addon platform v2 (accepted 2026-10-23, one version per step)

Goal: an addon written by any user (or their AI) can show live data in a WRM window, keep its settings and survive restarts, without being able to read WRM secrets, reach arbitrary hosts, hang the app or escalate beyond what was approved. Decisions: every user may install personal addons (network access and secrets are approved by an administrator); secrets per instance entered by an administrator, with a personal override that wins; **no background checks or history in WRM** (addons fetch while their window is open; 24/7 alerting stays in the monitored system).

Delivered: v13.7.0 step 1 (manifest v2, personal addons, themes for Appearance, instances, server-side store, remembered windows, bridge v2 with watchdog, CSP and integrity, permission sheets; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

Next:
- **Step 2: HTTP proxy and secrets.** Manifest `http: {origins, paths, methods, secrets}`; `wrm:http` performed by WRM: method and size checks, exact origin and path prefix, DNS/IP checks (loopback, link-local, RFC1918 and metadata blocked unless the administrator approves the origin as private network), only `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `Range` forwarded plus one secret header (`bearer:`, `basic:`, `header:<name>:`), 10 s timeout, re-validated redirects, 8 MB response cap, rate limits (120/min, 20 concurrent, 2 s coalescing), audit without secret values. Secrets per instance (administrator) with a personal override; the panel references them and never reads them. Origins of personal addons need an administrator's approval.
- **Step 3: tooling for AI-made addons.** JSON Schema and `llms.txt` served by WRM, `wrm -addon-lint <dir>` (schema, files, traversal, remote scripts, `eval`, inline handlers, CSP hashes, wasm imports/exports, permission summary), `wrm -addon-dev <dir>` (the real CSP and a host shim with store and proxy, hot reload), structured diagnostics `{code, message, file, line, hint}`, starter templates (blank, fetch-and-render, grafana-panel, wasm-hook).
- Later, when needed: a separate addon origin (own host or port), safe mode after repeated startup crashes, signed addons and a registry with updates.

## Security and enterprise identity (accepted, versions before v12.7.0)

Goal: the same WRM fits a home lab, a small company and a large organisation. Security is checked automatically on every change, the operator chooses a security level, and companies sign in with their directory (Microsoft Entra ID / AD, LDAP, other identity providers) so every action is traceable to a domain user and can be stopped at once.

v12.6.20 delivered the continuous security pipeline, v12.6.21 signed releases, SBOM, build provenance and the nightly fuzz and ZAP tests, v12.6.22 the security levels (Home / Business / Enterprise), deviations and the security posture page, v12.6.23 roles, teams, step-up re-authentication, the break-glass administrator and handover on delete, v12.6.24 directory sign-in (OIDC), v12.6.25 LDAP / Active Directory and SCIM, v12.6.26 SIEM export, security alerts, *Stop user* and lockdown (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

Later, when needed: passkeys/WebAuthn, SAML 2.0, Kerberos/SPNEGO, trusted proxy headers, client certificates, encryption key in an external key store with key rotation, a CSP without `'unsafe-inline'`, encrypted backups.

## Medium without Docker (accepted direction, versions to follow)

Goal: Medium keeps the original deploy tool's interface, options and `deploy-config` format, but runs on WRM's own engine. No Docker runtime, no Python virtual environment, no dependency installation, and the same behaviour whether WRM runs on Linux or Windows.

Agreed design:
- **Interface:** the original tool's screens (overview, comparison, details/diff, plan and exclusions, dry run, confirmations, progress, lock, history and rollback, server/environment/project settings, YAML editor, config Git actions) stay as they are. WRM serves them and answers their requests from Go.
- **Configuration:** `deploy-config` (servers, environments, `projects/*.yaml`) stays the source of truth and is read without conversion. The editor keeps comments and layout; validation runs before every deploy.
- **Connections and keys:** destinations use the connections already saved in WRM (keys, vault/Bitwarden keys, host-key checks, jump hosts) instead of a separate SSH profile ZIP. Keys never leave WRM's store.
- **Transfer and state:** WRM's native SSH transfer, lock, backup, integrity check and rollback, writing the server-side state (`current.json`, `history.jsonl`, backups) in the format the original tool reads, so existing history stays valid.
- **Where builds run** (per project, shown in the plan before anything runs):
  - on the WRM host (for example WRM on a Linux server with the needed toolchain);
  - on a chosen Linux build server over SSH, in a temporary directory, with only the prepared source sent (no Git or SSH keys); the result is then transferred to the destinations;
  - no build (deploy the selected files as today).
  Platform and architecture of the build server are checked against the destinations.
- **Trust:** build and `post_deploy` commands still run code from the project/config; Medium stays limited to trusted operators.

Delivery plan (v12.6.0 delivered the deploy-config reader/validator, the native plan and the comparison with the original tool; v12.7.0 native deploy, dry run, lock, backup, history and rollback through WRM connections with a per-project engine switch; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)):
1. **v12.7.3 – build locations (delivered):** projects with a build step deploy natively; per project the build runs on the WRM host, on a chosen Linux build server over SSH (temporary directory, only the prepared source sent, no Git or SSH keys) or not at all, chosen and shown in the plan before anything runs, with the build server's platform and architecture checked against the destinations.
2. **v12.8.0 – switch-over:** the original tool's screens served from Go (details/diff, YAML editor, settings, config Git actions), `build_user`, line-ending handling (`eol_only`), native engine as the default on Linux and Windows; the Docker runtime becomes optional and is then retired.

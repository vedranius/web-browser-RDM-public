# Contributing to Web Remote Manager PRO

Thanks for helping to make WRM better! Bug reports, ideas, documentation, translations and code
are all welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** — open an issue using the *Bug report* template. Include your WRM version
  (`/api/version` or the top bar), OS, browser and steps to reproduce.
- **Report a security problem** — privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Please
  do not open a public issue for it.
- **Suggest an idea / feature** — open an issue using the *Feature request* template and describe
  the problem it solves.
- **Improve translations** — the UI strings live in the `LANGS` object in
  `remote-manager/static/index.html` (English and Croatian today; new languages are welcome).
- **Send a pull request** — for anything bigger than a small fix, please open an issue first so we
  can agree on the approach.

## Development

Requirements: Go (version from `remote-manager/go.mod`), Node.js is only needed for the JS syntax
check.

```bash
cd remote-manager
gofmt -l .                      # must print nothing
go vet ./...
go test -race -count=1 -timeout 45m ./...             # unit + integration tests (security, roles, 2FA, encryption, recording, audit…)
go build -o wrm-server .
HTTPS_SELF_SIGNED=1 PORT=8080 ./wrm-server   # open https://localhost:8080
```

Pull requests also run the [security checks](SECURITY.md#continuous-security-checks) (govulncheck, CodeQL, gosec against its baseline, staticcheck, gitleaks, workflow checks, dependency review). To run the main ones locally, see `.claude/skills/wrm-security-review/SKILL.md`. Do not add gosec findings to the baseline, or entries to `.gitleaks.toml`, without explaining why in the pull request; never commit real secrets, also not in tests. A new parser for uploaded or pasted files gets a fuzz target in `remote-manager/fuzz_test.go` (and a line in `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`); run one locally with `go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzName$' -fuzztime 60s .`.

Use a separate `DB_PATH` for development so you do not touch your real database. Voice calls need
HTTPS (or `localhost`) and two browser profiles or devices to test.

Code layout:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | Startup, routes, database schema & migrations, connections API, server-to-server transfer |
| `security.go` | Encryption of secrets, signed values, security headers, CSRF, HTTPS |
| `users.go`, `totp.go` | Accounts, sessions, sign-in, 2FA, admin user management |
| `settings.go`, `audit.go`, `admin.go` | Policies (feature flags), audit log (hash chain, append-only), admin panel API, terminal registry |
| `recording.go` | Terminal sessions, asciicast session recorder, file transfer log, recordings & transfers API |
| `shares.go`, `collab.go` | Shares, roles & permissions, collaboration rooms (chat, terminal sharing, voice signalling) |
| `turn.go` | Built-in TURN relay for voice calls |
| `ssh_ws.go`, `files.go`, `sftp_pool.go`, `search.go`, `conntest.go`, `hostkeys.go` | Terminal, file manager, SFTP connection pool, search, connection test, host key verification |
| `jump.go`, `tunnels.go` | Jump hosts (dialing through chains of SSH connections), SSH tunnels (local / remote / SOCKS5), tunnels API, web interface connections |
| `importers.go` | Import from mRemoteNG `confCons.xml` and OpenSSH config |
| `putty.go` | Import of PuTTY sessions (`.reg`) with their proxies; links mRemoteNG `PuttySession` |
| `snippets.go`, `status.go` | Snippets and run on connect; live up/down status monitor |
| `bookmarks.go` | Folder bookmarks: scopes, path variables, shell-quoted `cd`, start directory, WinSCP.ini import |
| `guac.go` | Remote desktop (RDP / VNC / Telnet) through guacd: handshake, relay, recording |

| `keys.go`, `credentials.go` | SSH key store (deploy, revoke, who has access) and credentials vault (sharing, host lists, password rotation) |
| `static/index.html` | The whole web UI (embedded into the binary); `static/vendor/` holds xterm.js, guacamole-common-js and fonts, `static/brand/` the logo and icons |
| `static/git.js` | The Git workspace, loaded when it is opened; its translations are `Object.assign(LANGS.en / LANGS.hr, …)` blocks at the top and `tools/check-ui.js` checks them with the page |
| `ai_*.go` | AI assistant: permission engine (`ai_engine.go`, `ai_policy.go`), read-only classifier (`ai_classify.go`, `ai_shell.go`), destructive patterns (`ai_destructive.go` — every rule needs a test case in `ai_policy_test.go`), tools, redaction, providers (`ai_llm.go`, `ai_cloud.go`, `ai_provider.go`) and the API |

The plugin must not declare `userConfig` (the Claude app cannot ask for it) or have a top-level `bin/` |
| `static/workboard.js`, `workboard.go` | The Workboard (addon windows on the shared canvas, addon catalog, addons docked as dynamic layout panels, canvas menu with grid, arrange, saved layouts, export/import), in-app notifications `/api/me/events` and server metrics `/api/workboard/metrics`; a new addon is an entry in `A` with `render` (and `load`), its texts in both languages |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the parts fit together and where planned features belong.

Before sending a PR please make sure that:

- `gofmt -l .` prints nothing, and `go vet ./...` and `go test -race ./...` pass,
- the page has no JavaScript errors (the CI extracts the inline script and runs `node --check`),
- new UI text has both `en` and `hr` entries in `LANGS`,
- every new API endpoint or WebSocket message checks **who** may use it (signed-in user, share role
  / permission, admin) on the server. The UI hiding a button is not access control,
- secrets (passwords, keys, tokens) are never returned to the browser or written to the log,
- security-relevant actions write an audit entry (`auditLog…`), and nothing updates or deletes audit data outside the retention job,
- new features that change behaviour sit behind a setting (feature flag), and the existing flow works with the flag off,
- you tested the change in a browser (terminal, file manager, sessions, collaboration and voice if
  you touched them).

The v12.4.0 regressions include `folders_test.go` (hierarchy, ownership, imports), `git_functionality_test.go` (workers, redaction and config boundaries), `preview_test.go` (SFTP/FTP ranges, active content and share permissions) and `ai_availability_test.go` (SFTP providers and policy events). Run `node tools/check-ui.js` and `node --test tools/test-git-simple.js tools/test-ai-events.js tools/test-appimage.js tools/test-workspace-context.js` from the repository root. UI layout/media checks require a real browser; retain a concise report that distinguishes compiled platforms from platforms actually run.

CI (GitHub Actions) builds every platform for each pull request.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or abusive behaviour is not tolerated.

## v12.4.3 integration regressions

Run `python3 tools/test-medium-wrapper.py` from the root in addition to the full Go race/vet/format/UI/Node checks. `v1243_test.go` covers Medium ZIP/proxy/origin boundaries, config profile ownership/masking/path rules, folder ordering/imports and mocked Bitwarden account isolation plus actual SSH authentication. The native SSH/rsync test requires those binaries; it skips when absent. Original-tool parity uses the privately supplied archive and its pinned suite; do not commit private source, configs, keys or screenshots containing real hostnames. Distinguish source-suite coverage from actions exercised through the bridge and mock Bitwarden login from a live cloud account.

The optional original runtime is not a sandbox and must be described as trusted executable code. Keep its native modules/templates unchanged when verifying 1:1 behavior; bridge changes belong in WRM or the embedded wrapper. Runtime artifacts belong outside source control. Test responsive dialogs and folder-order persistence in a real browser.

For v12.4.3b, `git_medium_runtime_test.go` covers backend selection, mount/argv/readiness boundaries, missing-runtime source retention and letter-hotfix version parsing. Wrapper tests cover aliased environment and private SSH-home resolution. Exercise the pinned-image import and native deploy/rollback against local fixtures; test stop/start persistence and builder access denial. Windows cross-builds do not substitute for a live Windows Desktop/CLI-context test: state that limitation. Keep runtime source/profiles/volumes private and distinguish the accepted v12.4.4 plan from completed hotfix work.

## v12.4.4 regression checks

Include `v1244_test.go`, `v1244_extra_test.go` and `git_relay_test.go` in the full race suite. Exercise a delayed response header, total/idle cancellation, mutable grant policy and pending/active invalidation, SFTP inventory/path denial, root/symlink/log rotation/timezone/cursor bounds, validated visual labels and immutable reviewed deployment targets. Relay fixtures must use canonical Git blob hashes and demonstrate client-only tokens, isolated membership, failed/out-of-order publication and disconnect/restart persistence.

Use isolated generic browser/agent fixtures for Monitoring, simultaneous live panels, Functionality hostname filters, real XML/registry uploads, MCP controls/install scripts, terminal startup/context and replay at phone/desktop widths. Never add private attachments, actual hostnames, exported credentials or downloaded fixture databases to the repository. Distinguish actual Zabbix/PSK/provider requests from protocol mocks and cross-builds from native OS runs. See [v12.4.4 validation](docs/RELEASE_SUMMARY_v12.4.4.md).

`node --test tools/test-git-client.js` verifies client relay response bytes and cancellation at the 8 MiB budget, including responses without a declared Content-Length. The release workflow runs it with the existing Node suites.

For Medium/Monitoring changes, run `node --test tools/test-monitoring.js` and the v12.4.5 Go regressions. Test actual progressive discovery, date-only and keyword historical searches, tab changes during pending requests, timezone/event details, combined environment filters and all sticky control rows at phone/desktop widths. Use generic service/config fixtures only. Windows Docker first-install paths need a real Windows session for runtime verification; Linux Docker tests/cross-builds do not establish that result.

# Writing WRM PRO addons (apiVersion 2)

An addon is a ZIP with `addon.json` at its root (or one folder down) and the files it declares. Nothing runs at install time: WRM checks the manifest, the paths and the declared files, pins the SHA-256 of every file, and installs the addon **disabled**. Enabling it shows a permission sheet that WRM generates from `addon.json`.

A manifest without `apiVersion` is a v1 addon and keeps working as before. This page describes **apiVersion 2**, available since v13.9.0.

## Who installs what

- **Organisation addons** are installed by an administrator for everybody (*Settings → Addons*, *Install for: Everybody*). They may carry WebAssembly server code (`server.wasm`).
- **Personal addons** can be installed by any user the policy `addon_personal` allows (default: everybody). Only the user who installed one sees it. They run in the same sandbox and cannot carry server code. Administrators see every user's personal addons and can turn one off or remove it.

## addon.json

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 2,
  "id": "demo.counter",
  "name": "Demo counter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Counts clicks and keeps the count on the server.",
  "author": "Your name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "homepage": "https://example.com/addon",
  "capabilities": ["ui.panel", "ui.theme", "store", "notify"],
  "ui": {
    "panel": "panel.html",
    "title": "Counter",
    "defaultSize": { "w": 420, "h": 260 },
    "minSize": { "w": 300, "h": 180 },
    "themes": [
      { "id": "ocean", "name": "Ocean", "name_hr": "Ocean", "mode": "dark",
        "tokens": { "--bg": "#0b1220", "--accent": "#38bdf8" }, "css": "ocean.css" }
    ]
  },
  "store": { "quotaKb": 16, "shared": false }
}
```

Rules:

- **Unknown fields are rejected** (`E_MANIFEST_FIELD`), including nested ones, so a misspelt field never silently grants nothing.
- `id`: 2-64 characters, lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_`. `name` 1-80, `version` 1-32 characters. Versions compare as dotted numbers (`1.10.0` is newer than `1.9.3`). A lower version than the installed one needs an explicit confirmation (`E_DOWNGRADE`).
- `capabilities` is the grant list. A block without its capability, or a capability this WRM does not know, refuses the install.

| Capability | What it allows |
|---|---|
| `ui.panel` | a window inside WRM (`ui.panel`, `ui.title`, `ui.defaultSize`, `ui.minSize`) |
| `ui.theme` | colour themes users pick in *Settings → Appearance* (`ui.themes`, or the v1 `ui.theme` stylesheet) |
| `store` | settings kept on the WRM server per instance (`store.quotaKb` 1-1024, default 64; `store.shared`) |
| `notify` | short notifications from the panel |
| `server.wasm` | WebAssembly server code, organisation addons only (see the v1 documentation in ARCHITECTURE.md) |

`store` and `notify` need `apiVersion: 2` and a panel.

### Themes

`ui.themes` holds up to 16 themes. Each has an `id` (lowercase letters, digits, dash, up to 32), `name` and optional `name_hr` (up to 60 characters), `mode` (`light` or `dark`) and `tokens` and/or `css`:

- `tokens` are CSS variables of WRM: `--bg --bg2 --bg3 --bg4 --bg5 --border --border2 --text --text2 --text3 --accent --green --red --yellow --purple --font-ui --font-mono --radius` and the terminal palette. Names must look like `--name`; values are plain values (colours, lengths, font lists) without `;`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, `url(`, `@import` or `expression`.
- `css` is a stylesheet in the ZIP.

A theme from an addon is never applied to everybody: it appears in *Settings → Appearance* and is used by the people who pick it.

## The panel

The panel is an HTML page in an `iframe` with `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, so it has an opaque origin: it cannot read WRM, its cookies, its storage or another panel. apiVersion 2 panels are served with this Content Security Policy:

```
sandbox allow-scripts; default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-<each inline script>';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self' data:;
media-src 'self' data: blob:; connect-src 'none'; form-action 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'
```

What that means for your code:

- **No network of its own**: `fetch`, XHR and WebSocket are blocked. A proxied HTTP capability for allow-listed sites is planned; until then a panel works with what the user enters and what it stores.
- Scripts are files of the ZIP or inline `<script>` blocks (WRM allows each inline block by its hash). **Inline event handlers** (`onclick="…"`), `eval` and remote scripts or fonts do not run: use `addEventListener`.
- Use a `ResizeObserver` to redraw charts when the window changes size.

Every file is pinned by SHA-256 when the addon is installed. A file that changes on disk afterwards, or a file added later, is refused (`E_INTEGRITY`) until the addon is installed again.

## The bridge (postMessage)

The panel talks only to the WRM page around it: `window.parent.postMessage(message, '*')`. Every message the panel sends carries `v: 2`; anything else is dropped and shown in the window's diagnostics.

Panel → WRM:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:ready'}` | send it on load, **within 5 seconds**, or the window shows "did not start" |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:heartbeat'}` | every 15 seconds; three missed heartbeats show "not responding" |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:context'}` | ask for the context again |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:store.get', id, key}` | read a stored value |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:store.set', id, key, value}` | store any JSON value (32 KB at most) |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:notify', text, level}` | a notification: plain text up to 200 characters, `level` is `info`, `success`, `warn` or `error`; at most 5 a minute per instance, a repeat within 5 minutes is dropped |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:resize', w, h}` | ask for a content size; WRM decides (not when snapped, pinned or the layout is locked) |
| `{v:2, type:'wrm:error', message, source, line}` | report an error into the window's diagnostics (⚠ in the title bar) |

WRM → panel:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `wrm:context` | `{v, user: {id, name}, lang, theme: {"--bg": …}, addon: {id, key, version, instance, instanceName}, config: {…stored values…}, features: {store, notify, http: false, jobs: false, history: false, visibility: true}, size: {w, h}, visible}` |
| `wrm:theme` | `{theme}` after the user switched the theme |
| `wrm:visibility` | `{visible}`: the window was minimized or restored, or the browser tab hidden. **Stop polling and timers while hidden.** |
| `wrm:store` | the answer to a store request: `{id, key, value}`, or `{id, key, error, code}` |
| `wrm:fatal` | `{code, message}` right before WRM closes the panel (addon disabled or removed) |

`user.name` is the display name, never the sign-in name. WRM runs **no background jobs** for addons: a panel works while its window is open, and 24/7 alerting belongs in the monitored system (for example Grafana alerting).

## Instances, store and windows

An addon with a panel can be opened as several **instances**, each with its own stored values and window (for example two dashboards). Opening the panel the first time creates an instance named *Default*. *Settings → Addons → Instances* creates, renames, exports, imports and removes them.

- An administrator can create **shared** instances of an organisation addon; everybody who can use the addon sees them. Your own instances are visible only to you.
- **Store scope:** a personal instance keeps the owner's values. In a shared instance each user has their own values, unless the manifest says `"store": {"shared": true}`: then there is one set for everybody, written by administrators (`E_STORE_READONLY` for others).
- Keys: 1-64 characters (letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_`), not starting with `wrm.`. Values: JSON, 32 KB each, `quotaKb` per instance in total (`E_LIMIT_QUOTA`).
- **Export / Import** writes or reads a file `{"format": "wrm-addon-config", "addon", "version", "instance", "values"}`.
- The place and size of each window are remembered per user on the server, so an open window comes back after a reload, a restart or on another device.

## Approvals and updates

Enabling an addon approves its permission sheet. An update that asks for **more** (a new capability, a larger store, a shared store, more server exports) is installed but stays **off until the sheet is approved again**; the new lines are marked. An update that asks for the same or less keeps the addon enabled.

## Error codes

Every refusal of the API carries `{error, code, hint}`:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E_MANIFEST` | addon.json breaks a rule (the message says which) |
| `E_MANIFEST_FIELD` | an unknown field in an apiVersion 2 manifest |
| `E_API_VERSION` | `apiVersion` is not 1 or 2 |
| `E_MISSING_FILE` | a declared file is not in the ZIP |
| `E_LIMIT_SIZE` | archive or value too large |
| `E_LIMIT_QUOTA` | the store of the instance is full |
| `E_LIMIT_COUNT` | too many instances (50 per user per addon) |
| `E_STORE_KEY`, `E_STORE_VALUE` | invalid key, value is not JSON |
| `E_STORE_READONLY` | shared values are written by administrators |
| `E_CAPABILITY` | the addon does not declare what it tried to use |
| `E_DISABLED` | the addon is disabled |
| `E_INTEGRITY` | a file changed after the install |
| `E_DOWNGRADE` | an older version than the installed one; confirm with `allow_downgrade=1` |
| `E_PERSONAL_OFF`, `E_PERSONAL_SERVER` | personal addons are turned off; personal addons cannot carry server code |
| `E_NOT_FOUND` | the addon or instance does not exist (for you) |

In the panel, `wrm:store` answers carry the same codes, and *Diagnostics* lists the last 20 bridge errors (`E_BRIDGE`, `E_LIMIT_RATE`, …).

## A minimal panel

```html
<!doctype html><html><body>
<h3 id="who">…</h3><p>Count: <b id="n">0</b></p><button id="inc">+1</button>
<script>
const send = m => parent.postMessage(Object.assign({v: 2}, m), '*');
let n = 0;
addEventListener('message', e => {
  const d = e.data || {};
  if (d.type === 'wrm:context') {
    document.getElementById('who').textContent = d.addon.instanceName;
    n = (d.config && d.config.count) || 0;
    document.getElementById('n').textContent = n;
  }
});
document.getElementById('inc').addEventListener('click', () => {
  n++; document.getElementById('n').textContent = n;
  send({type: 'wrm:store.set', id: 'c' + n, key: 'count', value: n});
});
send({type: 'wrm:ready'});
setInterval(() => send({type: 'wrm:heartbeat'}), 15000);
</script></body></html>
```

*Settings → Addons → AI addon* gives the same rules as a prompt for an AI client; with the addon tools the WRM assistant writes a draft you review and install.
